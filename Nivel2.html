                    <h2>CULTURA</h2>
                    <p>Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America.[276] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh,
                        dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural
                        Properties and National Treasures.[277] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[102] Japan is considered a cultural superpower.</p>

                    <h2>GASTRONOMÍA</h2>
                    <p>Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[306] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[307] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan
                        from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[308][309] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[310] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used.
                        More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.[311] Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[312] Beer has
                        been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[313] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.</p>

                    <h2>TURISMO</h2>
                    <p>Across much of Japan, the summer is characterized by hot and humid weather. Taking refuge from the heat, many locals opt for cooler climates near the ocean or up in the mountains. As the heat begins to wane in the evenings, people
                        partake in regional fireworks displays, traditional song and dance, and centuries-old festivals. <br> Traditional summer festivals provide an opportunity to witness local culture firsthand. Towns across the country present one-of-a-kind
                        celebrations featuring traditional mikoshi floats, dancing, costumes, and ample amounts of food and drink. Join the revelry for genuine fun and a closer connection to the culture. Located in the northern prefecture of Aomori, the
                        Aomori Nebuta Festival attracts thousands of visitors eager to watch a procession of enchanting illuminated floats running along the streets. The festivities last from August 2 to 7, with a fireworks finale on the last day.</p>

                    <h2>VIDA NOCTURNA</h2>
                    <p>Japan's nightlife is fantastic. The sheer scale of entertainment possibilities in the cities is astounding. From cool craft beer hangouts to high-end whiskey establishments and a great variety of novelty bars, the old cliche that there's
                        something for everyone holds true here. Whether you want to rub shoulders with locals over a beer at a cozy izakaya, or dance until dawn at one of Tokyo's mega clubs, there's a seemingly infinite number of options. It's easy to
                        see how Japan earned its reputation as home to some of the best nightlife in the world.</p>

                    <p>Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[296] Western classical music,
                        introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.</p>
